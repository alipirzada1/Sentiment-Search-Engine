-> Folder prepFiles contains all the files needed to train and test the svm 

-> The algorithm was trained over 48000 instances and tested over 2000 instances with 1000 features details are in "details.txt" file read it

-> Another algorithm was trained over 40000 instances and tested over 5000 instances with 1000 features details are in "details.JPG"

-> All the file whose name start with "pickle" are generated through code and are written in bytes the code files ie ".py" files use these files

-> File extras0.py, extras1.py and extras2.py contains extra codes for testing before putting into the file learning.py

-> Some Codes is commented out try every bit separately in order to understand its working
